# San-Francisco-Airport-Clustering-Analysis
In this project, we will conduct a clustering analysis of San Francisco Airport. We aim to uncover patterns and groupings within the airport's data, potentially identifying areas of interest or improvement.

One key technique we will employ is the Elbow Method, which will help us determine the optimal number of clusters for our analysis. By visualizing the Elbow Method, we can gain insights into the structure of the data and make informed decisions for airport-related strategies.
